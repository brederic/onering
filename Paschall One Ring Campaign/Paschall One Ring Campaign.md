Welcome to Sly Flourish's Lazy RPG Campaign Template for [Notion.so](http://notion.so). This Notion notebook helps you organize and run your tabletop RPGs using the style and steps from [_Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master_](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master). Read [Using Notion for Lazy D&D Prep](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_dnd_with_notion.html) or watch [this video on Notion for Lazy Dungeon Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AfbMNAsyr4).

### Duplicate and Customize the Template

Duplicate this notebook for each campaign you run by clicking the three dots in the upper right and clicking “duplicate”. Customize your copy to suit your own style. Delete all the instructional text. Come back to this original template for changes and updates.

"Configure the template" for the "Generate Session Planning Template" button (the little gear icon on the right when highlighting the button) to tailor your own session notes page and get rid of the instructional text. Then create new session notes by clicking "Generate Session Planning Template" below and renaming the page to the date and campaign.

This notebook uses two underlying databases: the character database and the campaign database. Each holds cards for characters, NPCs, villains, items, and locations.

Add character information including pictures, character sheets, links to online character sheets, and notes to the Character Database. Add NPCs, villains, items, and Locations to the Campaign Database. The Characters, NPCs, Locations, Villains, and Items pages are views into the campaign database filtered on the appropriate tags. Both databases contain sample characters, NPCs, villains, and locations. Add images to every card to inspire you and give you images to share with your players.

### Monsters and Combat Tracking

This notebook works with the [![](Paschall%20One%20Ring%20Campaign%20fcce91dafae8460a8147a4a5ac4747a8/Untitled.png)5e Artisanal Monster Database – Description and Instructions](https://www.notion.so/5e-Artisanal-Monster-Database-Description-and-Instructions-f079e27166af408f8717888e0e5b5fbe?pvs=21), a Notion database of more than 2,400 searchable and sortable OGL-released monster stat blocks from six different monster books along with a database view that lets you track combat encounters during the game. You can download it separately and use it for all of your campaigns from just the one copy. It’s really big which makes duplication slow so that’s why it’s not included here.

(Remove the above instructions once you’ve duplicated the template.)

# Template Change Log

Here's a list of most recent changes to this campaign template. Remove this section when copying the template. Check back on the original template to see what changed.

## 15 May 2023

Added NPC and location table views to the session templates that automatically shows NPCs and locations tagged with “current” in a list. This way current NPCs and locations are already listed in the notes. Also added a description of incorporating the 5e Artisanal Monster Database in the monsters section of the template.

## 4 March 2023

Separated the [5e Artisanal Monster Database](https://www.notion.so/5e-Artisanal-Monster-Database-Description-and-Instructions-f079e27166af408f8717888e0e5b5fbe?pvs=21) into a separate page so one need not download both every time. The database is big and takes a long time to duplicate. The monster database now includes stat blocks for every monster in it.

Updated the instructions.

## 4 February 2023

Added 5e SRD monsters into the database now that most of them are released under a Creative Commons license. Included duckduckgo links for _Monster Manual_ monsters that try their best to send you to the right D&D Beyond page to look up a monster.

## 20 January 2023

Added and updated the Creature Database and to aid DMs in selecting creatures and tracking combat during games. Thanks to TBrook for the concept and Nicole Vanderhoven for her [monster database](https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/xios-guide-to-monsters).
