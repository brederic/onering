# Intro

_This Notion template is designed to help you build a single-session adventure using the eight steps from_ _[Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/returnofthelazydm/)__. Duplicate and edit your copy of this page for your own single-page eight-step prep sheet._

_Inspire your adventure with the tables in the_ _[Lazy DM's Workbook](https://slyflourish.com/lazydmsworkbook/)_ _and the_ [_Lazy DM's Companion_](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-companion-pdf-map-pack)_._

# Fifteen Minute Session Zero Checklist

_When running a one-shot game, use the following checklist to quickly get the players up to speed on your game. See page 10 of the_ _[Lazy DM’s Companion](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-companion-pdf-map-pack)_ _for details._

- [ ] Introduce the theme of the adventure. Is it an investigation? Combat focused? Deep dungeon delving? Mostly social interaction? Let the players know what they’re in for.
- [ ] Reinforce the characters’ primary motivation to enjoy the adventure (“Your characters work together in cooperation to protect the citizens of the City of Arches”)
- [ ] Describe safety tools (see page 9 of the [_Lazy DM’s Companion_](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-companion-pdf-map-pack) for details)
    - [ ] **Lines:** Character-initiated torture, non-consensual sexual contact or harassment, non-consensual inter-party conflict, animal abuse, sexism or misogyny, anti-LGBT sentiments
    - [ ] **Veils:** Racism, consensual sexual contact, torture.
    - [ ] “Pause for a minute” (page 9 [LDMC](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-companion-pdf-map-pack))
- [ ] Have players introduce the characters. Suggest inter-character connections (page 10 [LDMC](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-companion-pdf-map-pack))
- [ ] Run your strong start!

# Fantastic Locations

_What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some_ [_inspirational monuments_](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html)_. Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details._

- L**ocation 1**: feature, feature, feature
- L**ocation 2**: feature, feature, feature

# NPCs

_What_ [_NPCs_](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) _might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting_ [_name_](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) _and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures._

- NPC 1
- NPC 2

# Monsters

_What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "_[_deadly benchmark_](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)_". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level._

- **Deadly Encounter Benchmark:**
- Monster 1
- Monster 2
- Monster 3

# Treasure

_Choose some interesting_ [_treasure_](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/5e_treasure.html) _and maybe a handful of_ [_relics_](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/relics.html)_._

- Gold, gems, etc
- Relics
- Items

## Scratchpad

_Use this for text-based combat trackers, hit point tracking, or anything else you need during your game._
