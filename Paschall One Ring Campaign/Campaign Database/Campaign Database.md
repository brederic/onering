This is the campaign database which holds cards for NPCs, Locations, Villains, and Items. You can use this database to store any individual component in your campaign and then build pages that view and filter on a particular tag by making a new top-level page and selecting "Create Linked Database" to add in a filtered view of the campaign database.
